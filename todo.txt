General:

* Check documentation for references.

* Version check between kernel module and userhdhomerun application?
  * Print out version of userhdhomerun in help.

* Wait for /dev/dvb to startup?
#!/bin/bash
service dvbhdhomerun-utils start
while [ ! -d /dev/dvb ]
do
        sleep 1
done
service tvheadend start

Kernel Module:

* Remove unneeded DVB functions.

* Init:
  * Need error checking in _init function

* Debug
  * Decide which functions to put under each bit pattern.


UserHDHomerun:

* Need to use conf file to configure number of tuners?

* Use strstr on "atsc"/"cablecard" or "dvbt" to autodetect. OpenElec has a
  patch.

* Timestamp in log?

* Add locking of tuner?
