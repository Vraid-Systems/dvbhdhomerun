Ubuntu 9.10, 10.04, 10.10:
=========================

$SRC is the root of the source directory.

Kernel:
------

cd $SRC/kernel

make
sudo make install

REMARK: You need to do a few things before modprobe'ing the kernel
module the first time - see "Configuration/Setup" below).

sudo modprobe dvb_hdhomerun (check dmesg for problems)


Libhdhomerun:
------------

Normally just install the library: 

  sudo apt-get install libhdhomerun-dev

If you need to build it yourself:

Fetch the user space libraries from SiliconDust's homepage:
http://www.silicondust.com/support/hdhomerun/downloads/linux/

untar the package (tar xvfz libhdhomerun_xxx.tgz) to a directory of
your choice. In that directory:

cd libhdhomerun
make


Userhdhomerun:
-------------

sudo apt-get install cmake g++
    (libraries/tools needed to compile the below)

cd $SRC/userhdhomerun

(If you compiled the libhdhomerun yourself then Open CMakelists.txt
and change the LIBHDHOMERUN_PATH to the libhdhomerun directory you
just untar'ed.)

make

REMARK: You need to do a few things before running the app the first
time - see "Configuration/Setup" below).

make run 

After "make run" leave that cmd prompt running.


Configuration/Setup:
-------------------

Notice: The steps below are only necessary if you run userhdhomerun as
a "normal" user. If you run userhdhomerun using sudo (sudo make run)
then they are not needed.

You need preform these three steps once before modprobe'ing the kernel
module and/or running the application:

1) sudo cp $SRC/debian/dvbhdhomerun-utils.udev /etc/udev/rules.d/.
   (this makes the /dev/hdhomerun_xyz devices part of the "video"
   group.)

2) sudo service udev restart
   (sets above udev rule in effect.)

3) sudo usermod -a -G video userXYZ 
   (Replace userXYZ with you own user. Logout of your session and then
   login again to have effect. This is to add the user to the "video"
   group allowing him to use DVB devices. Verify with "groups" in cmd
   prompt.)
